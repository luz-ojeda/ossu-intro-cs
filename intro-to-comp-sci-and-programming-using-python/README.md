# [MITx: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python](https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-science/massachusetts-institute-of-technology-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-using-python)
## Computational thinking: the process
1. Identify or invent useful abstractions
	- Suppressing details and/or formulating interfaces
2. Formulate solution to a problem as a computational experiment using the abstractions
3. Design and construct a sufficiently efficient implementation of experiment
4. Validate experimental setup, through debugging for example
5. Run experiment
6. Evaluate results of experiment
7. Repeat as needed
## The three A's of Computational Thinking are:
### Abstraction
### Automation
### Algorithms
The language to describe the automated processed which allow abstraction of ideas as well
