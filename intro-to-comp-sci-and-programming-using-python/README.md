# [MITx: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python](https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-science/massachusetts-institute-of-technology-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-using-python)

## Week 1: Python basics

- Expressions and variables
- Iterations
- Languages

## Week 2: Simple Programs

### Notes
- Bisection search
- Floats and fractions
- Functions

### Scripts

- [Calculate GCD through recursion](https://github.com/luz-ojeda/ossu-intro-cs/blob/master/intro-to-comp-sci-and-programming-using-python/w2-simple-programs/gcd-recur.py)
- [Guess my number game](https://github.com/luz-ojeda/ossu-intro-cs/blob/master/intro-to-comp-sci-and-programming-using-python/w2-simple-programs/guess-my-number.py)
- [Check if character is in alphabetized string through recursion](https://github.com/luz-ojeda/ossu-intro-cs/blob/master/intro-to-comp-sci-and-programming-using-python/w2-simple-programs/is-in-recur.py)
- [Calculate power of a number through iteration](https://github.com/luz-ojeda/ossu-intro-cs/blob/master/intro-to-comp-sci-and-programming-using-python/w2-simple-programs/power-iter.py)
- [Calculate power of a number through recursion](https://github.com/luz-ojeda/ossu-intro-cs/blob/master/intro-to-comp-sci-and-programming-using-python/w2-simple-programs/recur-power.py)

### Problem set
- [Problem 1 - Paying Debt off in a Year](https://github.com/luz-ojeda/ossu-intro-cs/blob/master/intro-to-comp-sci-and-programming-using-python/w2-simple-programs/problem-set-2/problem-1.py)
  - CalculateS the credit card balance after one year if a person only pays the minimum monthly payment required by the credit card company each month.
- [Problem 2 - Paying Debt Off in a Year](https://github.com/luz-ojeda/ossu-intro-cs/blob/master/intro-to-comp-sci-and-programming-using-python/w2-simple-programs/problem-set-2/problem-2.py) using fixed monthly payment instead of minimum
- [Problem 3 - Using Bisection Search to Make the Program Faster](https://github.com/luz-ojeda/ossu-intro-cs/blob/master/intro-to-comp-sci-and-programming-using-python/w2-simple-programs/problem-set-2/problem-3.py)
  - Same as Problem 2 but finding the lowest monthly payment through bisection search instead of multiples of 10
