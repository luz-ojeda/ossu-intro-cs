Programming languages as well as speaking languages both have syntax and semantics

Its a model of 3 layers... if something is syntactically invalid it will be static semantically and semantically invalid. But if something is invalid semantically it may be syntactically correct.
## Syntax
Determine a sentence is legal or not:
- cat dog boy not valid
- casa lima pulir
- = "a" 5 not valid in Python
- console..log)( is not valid in JavaScript
## Static semantics
Determine which syntactically valid strings have meaning
- I are hungry syntactically valid but static semantic error
- 3+"hi"
- int myInt = "notAnInt"
## Semantics
The meaning associated with syntactically correct string of symbols with no static semantics errors

The hardest to correct sometimes
