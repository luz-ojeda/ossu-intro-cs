- Instead of guessing from the beginning, we pick a number in the middle between 1 and x
- Example:
	- Root of x lies between 1 and x.
	- We pick a number between 1 and x
	- Was guess too big or too small?
	- If $g^2 > x$ then g is too big, we pick a number between 1 and g
## convergence
Guess converges to the answer on the order of $log_2N$ steps

Greatly reduces computation time against guessing from 1 to x, checking every case according to the step
