## [MITx Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python](https://github.com/luz-ojeda/ossu-intro-cs/tree/master/intro-to-comp-sci-and-programming-using-python)

I did this course already knowing a considerable amount of Python since I used it in college for statistical analysis, hobbie pet projects and some jobs. Took notes of concepts I found interesting and/or new to me as well as problem solutions.
